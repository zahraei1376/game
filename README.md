## Game

This project is a dice game.
There are **two players**, by clicking on **Roll dice button**, two random numbers will appear on the dice, and as long as one of the dice is not number 1, the player can add to his score by pressing the roll button, and when the number 1 comes, his score will be zero. And it is the turn of the next player.
The player can click the **hold button** before this happens to save his score and become the next turn opener.

**Note:** the sum of the points displayed in the box card until the hold button is not clicked is the temporary point to be displayed.
